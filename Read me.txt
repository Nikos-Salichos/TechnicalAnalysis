You can generate this file by completing the following steps:

1) Run cmd as admin

2) cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin

This command back up object definitions + data
3) pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 TechnicalAnalysis > C:\Users\Nikos\source\repos\TechnicalAnalysis\createTables.sql

This command can be used to back up schema only:
pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 --schema-only TechnicalAnalysis > C:\Users\Nikos\source\repos\TechnicalAnalysis\createTables_schemaonly.sql

Note:
I suggest you to use the existing one, because you need to insert providers the first time that you will use it.
